# AutRelChecker
R Functions for automating intercoder reliability checking for nominal data - DEPRECATED

This was a helper script designed for fast testing of reliability in Content Analysis for non-coders. Code is VERY old and would defintely benefit from upgrades.
Made public and then archived for portfolio reasons and since it is no longer needed to be used. If you are seeing this code for some reason, i would HIGHLY recommend not using blindly and actually informing yourself over how and why to perform reliability testing before using it. This code makes a large number of assumptions over the data to be used and can lead to misleading results without carefull consideration.
